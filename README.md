# Poker Game with AI Opponent
This project aimed to develop a Poker game with an AI opponent implemented in Java. 

## Features
- **Standard Poker Rules:** Implements the traditional rules of Poker, including hand rankings, betting rounds, and showdown.
- **AI Opponent:** An AI player that uses probabilistic reasoning to make decisions, providing a challenging opponent for human players.
- **Card Dealing:** Randomized card dealing to ensure fairness and unpredictability in each game.
- **Betting System:** Supports betting, raising, folding, and all-in actions.
- **Hand Evaluation:** Accurate hand evaluation to determine the winner at the end of each round.
- **Log File:** Creates a log file of every game.

## Running The Program
Compile and run "Main.java"

## Game Settings
All game settings could be changed in "Game.java"

## Additional Notes
If there is a problem with the unicode of the suit representations, change "suitRepresentation" boolean to false in "Deck.java". This will change the "♠ ♦ ♣ ♥" to "$ # % &".
