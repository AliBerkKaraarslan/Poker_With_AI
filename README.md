# Poker in Java
Original Texas Hold'em Poker in Java With AI Bots.

## Running The Program
To run the program, compile and run "Main.java"

## Developer Notes
PokerBot has not totally finished. They could only give "fold" and "check/call" command currently. In development.

## Additional Notes
If there is a problem with the unicode of the suit representations, change "suitRepresentation" boolean to false in "Deck.java". This will change the "♠ ♦ ♣ ♥" to "$ # % &".
